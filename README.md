Code Rivals


Code Rivals is an engaging, web-based game designed to help you sharpen your C++ programming skills. It offers a variety of modes to keep learning fun and competitive. You can dive into multiplayer Q&A battles to test your knowledge of C++ concepts or challenge yourself in 1v1 fill-in-the-blank code challenges to perfect your syntax. For those looking to learn at their own pace, the solo coding challenge provides a series of C++ problems with instant feedback from an integrated AI judge. The game also features a simple login and signup system to track your solo challenge progress, real-time leaderboards to see how you stack up against other players, and an in-game chat to connect with fellow coders.
